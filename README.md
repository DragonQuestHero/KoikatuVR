# VRGIN.Template
Generic template project that illustrates how to use [VRGIN](https://github.com/Eusth/VRGIN).


# Getting Started
## Building

1. Checkout the project (recursively, because VRGIN is included as a submodule)
    ```sh
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Eusth/VRGIN.Template.git
    cd VRGIN.Template
    ```
2. Open the solution (**\*.sln**) file
3. Start the build in the Release configuration

This will generate all you need inside `bin\Release`. (This should be the same output as on the [releases page](https://github.com/Eusth/VRGIN.Template/releases))

## Installing

1. Extract contents into a Unity folder
2. Drag the game executable onto **IPA.exe**

## Usage

Start the game while SteamVR is running or use the `--vr`.
